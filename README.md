# Liv tools 

## Liv-Tools is (gonna be) a bunch of really simple terminal applications with these goals in mind
- Keep the programs as small as possible (no bloat)
- Keep the code as readable as possible
- Keep the programs useful in some way, ether for me and others to learn or to actually use for day to day
- Keep the program as easy to use as possible
- Use the C programming language or Shell Scripts to create these applications

## where is applications?

### currently i am in the progress of creating my first Liv-Tool! hang tight
